# README

This is a survey app that will allow for branching based on answers to questions and its database will provide a record of how users answered.  


This is built with:

- **rails**: 8.0
- **ruby**: 3.4.2

Future improvements
- CSS styling
- Currently, a user has a session and ID based on a browser cookie. Authentication can be added in the future for users who may be on the same machine.
- Currently, survey data is hardcoded in seeds.rb. Future iterations may warrant a more dynamic creation UI. 

* System dependencies
  - Currently, this application requires a modern browser.
